# NXU Energy Mock Web App Showcase

## Overview

This project is a mock web application designed to showcase my expertise in React, Node, React Native, and other associated technologies. The application features a 3D model of a car using Three.js, and it leverages an SQL database populated with mock data.

## Features

- **Three.js Integration**: Display a 3D model of a car in a visually engaging manner.
- **Backend on AWS EC2**: Utilizes Node and Express to handle API requests efficiently.
- **Database on AWS RDS**: SQL database populated with mock data ensures realistic user interactions.
- **Frontend with Next.js**: Deployed on Vercel, delivering a fast and responsive user experience.
- **Authentication**: Incorporates bcrypt for password encryption and JWT for user session management.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Node, Express
- **Database**: SQL (hosted on AWS RDS)
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js
- **Authentication**: bcrypt, JWT
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2 (Backend), Vercel (Frontend)

now that you know about my mock project and resume can you edit this message to include a link and login info for the moc website:
Hello [Hiring Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to express my continued interest in the [Role Name] at nxu energy, and to sincerely thank you for considering my application.

I understand from my discussion with Jeff that there were concerns about the diversity of skills listed on my résumé, which might have created some ambiguity about my focus on React, React Native, and Node. While it's true that my startup experience has required me to become versatile, I want to clarify that my primary specialization and passion lies in these specific technologies.

To offer a bit more context:

I've built a real-time data analytics dashboard using React, reducing latency by 50%.
Led the development of a mobile app with React Native that has now been downloaded over 100,000 times with a 4.5-star rating.
Implemented a scalable microservices architecture using Node, which improved system responsiveness by 40%.
I have revised my résumé to better reflect this focus and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to share it with you for a second review.

The mission and projects at nxu energy excite me, and I'm eager to contribute my deep technical skills to your esteemed organization. Could we possibly discuss this further at your convenience?

Thank you again for your time and for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you.

Best regards,
Zach Rizzo

also I'm not entirely sure the position is still open so mention that.
